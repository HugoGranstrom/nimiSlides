# NimConf 2022
At NimConf 2022, I did a presentation on nimiSlides which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sf1TndCcIlU&list=PLxLdEZg8DRwSQQaK0UVRd1DaetVc3lIwr&index=7). The slides from the talk can be viewed at [https://hugogranstrom.com/nimiSlides/nimconf2022.html](https://hugogranstrom.com/nimiSlides/nimconf2022.html).

# Our goal ðŸ¥‡

Our goal is to provide the easiest way to create a slideshow in Nim, about Nim. And this while also providing
lots of flexibility so you can tailor it to your liking.
