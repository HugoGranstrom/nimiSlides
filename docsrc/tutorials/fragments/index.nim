# Fragments (Animations)
Fragments are what you would typically call animations in PowerPoint.
They allow you to show, hide and highlight different parts of your slide at a time.
If you want to fade in an image when you step forward, it is a fragment you will want to use.

If you don't have any experience with [Reveal.js's fragments](https://revealjs.com/fragments/),
I suggest you start with the [Basics of Fragments](./basics.html) tutorial.

You can see a list of the available fragments [here](./list_fragments.html).
